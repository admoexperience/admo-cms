Getting started
---------------
install [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build)


To run server in dev mode

    foreman start -f Procfile.dev

This runs

    rails s -p 3002

As well as live-reload

    guard

Or you can run both commands separately.
